The BrowserProvider in ethers.js is a feature that allows web applications to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
directly from the browser using wallet extensions like MetaMask. This provider wraps around EIP-1193 compatible
providers, enabling seamless connection, transaction signing, and smart contract interactions within a web browser
environment. It simplifies building decentralized applications (dApps) by providing a standardized interface for
blockchain operations.

### Key features

1. **EIP-1193 Compatibility**: Ensures interoperability with various Ethereum wallets.
2. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies connection to Ethereum accounts and interaction with the blockchain.
3. **Standardized API**: Provides a common interface for blockchain operations, making dApp development more straightforward.

### Example usage

```javascript
const provider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(window.ethereum);
const signer = await provider.getSigner();
console.log("Account:", await signer.getAddress());
```

### Considerations

- **Network Compatibility**: Ensure the wallet and the smart contract are on the same network to avoid errors.
- **Event Subscriptions**: Some issues exist with subscribing to certain events, which developers must handle appropriately.

### Additional library support

The [`zksync-ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zksync-ethers) library supports provider methods
from the [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/v6/api/providers) library. It supplies additional functionality,
enhancing the capabilities of BrowserProvider for applications that interact with ZKsync, a Layer 2 scaling
solution for Ethereum.

## Available providers

- **Provider**: Extends [`ethers.JsonRpcProvider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/jsonrpc/#about-jsonrpcProvider)
with ZKsync-specific methods.
- **BrowserProvider**: Extends the ZKsync Era `Provider` class for better compatibility with Web3 wallets.
