ZKsync Era offers several unique features compared to Ethereum, which require some specific handling. This guide will
help you understand these differences and how to work with them using the `zksync-ethers` library.

## Key differences

- **Account Abstraction**: ZKsync supports account abstraction, allowing accounts to have custom validation logic
and enabling paymaster support.
- **Deployment Transactions**: Contracts on ZKsync require bytecode to be passed in a separate field during deployment.
- **Fee System**: The fee system in ZKsync differs from Ethereum's, necessitating additional fields in transactions.

Everything inside `customData` in `overrides` is related to ZKsync(L2 gas, etc.).

## EIP712 transactions

To accommodate these differences, ZKsync extends standard Ethereum transactions with new fields, creating what are known
as EIP712 transactions. More details on EIP712 transactions can be found in the [ZKstack transaction lifecycle](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle#eip-712-0x71).

## Overrides in transactions

`ethers.js` can automatically find the best `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `nonce`, and other important fields for
transactions. But sometimes, you need to set these values yourself. For example, you might want to set a
lower `gasPrice` or use a specific `nonce`.

In such cases, you can use an `Overrides` object to provide these values. This object lets you set fields
like `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `nonce`, etc.

For ZKsync-specific fields, you need to use the `customData` object within the `overrides`. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const tx = {
  to: '0x...',
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
  overrides: {
    gasPrice: ethers.utils.parseUnits('10', 'gwei'),
    gasLimit: 21000,
    nonce: 0,
    customData: {
      gasPerPubdata: BigNumberish,
      factoryDeps: BytesLike[],
      customSignature: BytesLike,
      paymasterParams: {
        paymaster: Address,
        paymasterInput: BytesLike
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### CustomData Fields

- `gasPerPubdata`: Specifies L2 gas per published byte.
- `factoryDeps`: Array of contract bytecodes for deployment.
- `customSignature`: Custom signature for the transaction.
- `paymasterParams`: Parameters for using a paymaster.

### Example override

To deploy a contract with specific bytecode and a gas limit for published data:

```typescript
{
    customData: {
        gasPerPubdata: "100",
        factoryDeps: ["0xcde...12"],
    }
}
```

To use a custom signature and paymaster:

```typescript
{
    customData: {
        customSignature: "0x123456",
        paymasterParams: {
            paymaster: "0x8e1DC7E4Bb15927E76a854a92Bf8053761501fdC",
            paymasterInput: "0x8c5a3445"
        }
    }
}
```

### Encoding paymaster params

The ZKsync-ethers SDK includes a utility method for forming `paymasterParams` correctly, which is especially useful for
built-in paymaster flows.

```typescript
const paymasterParams = utils.getPaymasterParams(testnetPaymaster, {
  type: "ApprovalBased",
  token,
  minimalAllowance: fee,
  innerInput: new Uint8Array(),
});
```

## Using a paymaster with a contract method

Here is how you can call the `setGreeting` method of a `Contract` object `greeter` and pay fees with a testnet paymaster:

```typescript
const greeting = "a new greeting";
const tx = await greeter.populateTransaction.setGreeting(greeting);
const gasPrice = await sender.provider.getGasPrice();
const gasLimit = await greeter.estimateGas.setGreeting(greeting);
const fee = gasPrice.mul(gasLimit);

const paymasterParams = utils.getPaymasterParams(testnetPaymaster, {
  type: "ApprovalBased",
  token,
  minimalAllowance: fee,
  innerInput: new Uint8Array(),
});

const sentTx = await sender.sendTransaction({
  ...tx,
  maxFeePerGas: gasPrice,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: 0n,
  gasLimit,
  customData: {
    gasPerPubdata: utils.DEFAULT_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT,
    paymasterParams,
  },
});
```
